**DEEP CLEANER & ODOUR CONTROLLER**

A unique, effective biogenic
chemistry for total bathroom
deep cleaning and deodorizing at a microscopic
level.

PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER
is a technologically advanced deep
cleaner and deodorizer formulated for organic
waste common to all bathroom surfaces,
baths, showers, basins and toilets. 

>**PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER combines:**

>>• ***A novel bio-chemical formulation for
immediate odor control***

>>• ***A unique surfactant package for lifting dirt
and stains***

>>• ***The long lasting, microscopic deep cleaning
benefits of pro-bacterial bio-chemistry***

How does PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER work?

The chemistry for immediate odor control and biogenic
(bacterial) components targets odorous compounds for
degradation. 

The specialized pro-bacteria in PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER then biodegrade the organic
compounds that cause odor and staining, breaking
them down to benign and odorless compounds such as
carbon dioxide and water.

>>**Organic residues = CO 2 & H 2 O**

The combined effect makes PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER a highly effective, safe to use and
environmentally preferable odor controller and hard
surface cleaner.
