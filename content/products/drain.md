Probac DMC (Drain Maintenance
Cleaner) offers the ability to regain and
maintain control of restaurant grease
trap operations. 

Our new improved solution helps eliminate drain blockages,reduce embarrassing odors, and eliminate expensive
plumbing repairs and maintenance.

Probac® DMC can accomplish this like no other product because it leverages biological processes that are already underway in the grease trap and drainpipe environment.

Grease traps and drainage are one of the least understood and, often, the most problematic of all operations in the restaurant. 

Most restaurants are
required by law to install and maintain a grease trap to
prevent fats, oils, and grease (FOG) from flowing
directly into the wastewater system. 

Good kitchen
practices and regular manual cleaning are normally
required or drain stoppages, back-ups, and severe
malodors will occur. 

Repairs to clogged systems are
expensive and can result in costly interventions, and
disruption and inconvenience to the restaurant
operation and neighboring tenants.

Overpowering malodors bring health inspectors and
displeases workers and customers alike. 

High effluent
FOG levels can result in heavy fines in some
municipalities.

Most restaurants use some type of product to treat
drains or grease trap problems. 

Restaurants often use
chemical solvents which are highly alkaline or acid
based, which are hazardous to employees and the
environment. 

Since these chemicals work by mobilizing
FOG downstream, they circumvent the purpose of the
grease trap. 

Many municipalities disallow the use of
these chemicals for this reason. 

We know that these
chemicals also serve to sterilize FOG residue that
builds up in drain lines leading from the restaurant.

This residue is of a sticky, fatty consistency and acts as
a ‘magnet’ for the accumulation of more FOG. 

This
‘reactive’ intervention sets off further messy and
hazardous cycles of recurring blocked drains. 

There is
a better way, supplied by nature, to improve the
functionality of a restaurant’s wastewater drainage
system. 

Probac® DMC utilizes and optimizes
biological processes already at work in the grease trap
and drainage system.
