A safe and effective biological remedy for dealing with bad odour and suspended organics in used
water from bathing, dish washing and laundry washing.

Without treatment, grey water generally goes ‘off’ within 24 hours due to the organics and bacterial
contamination. 

The by-product of the bacteria is experienced as an unpleasant rotten smell.

PROBAC GWT beneficial bacteria are extremophiles and mostly anaerobic, with capabilities of functioning in low or zero oxygen, typical of standing stagnant grey water. 

These bacteria overwhelm and outcompete the unwanted smell-causing bacteria and rapidly convert the organics present into H2O, CO2 and micronutrient.

PROBAC GWT beneficial bacteria are selected for their by-product, which is odourless CO2. 

By predominating the field and banishing unwanted bacteria and pathogens, no bad smell is emitted or experienced, producing relatively clean water that remains odour free and safe for re-use for garden and lawn irrigating or toilet flushing, for up to 3-4 days, by which time it should be used.

NOTE: PROBAC beneficial bacteria are Category 1 Micro-organisms in the same class as medicinal probiotics, and are
harmless to humans and animals for dermal contact, inhalation and ingestion.

As conditions of use are beyond our control, no warranty is made on this product whatsoever.
