PROBAC® Biologicals combines non-harmful natural elements with beneficial bacteria that
actively biodegrade dirt in the process of cleaning. 

PROBAC® Biologicals, with its unique REFRESH ODORTECHTM technology, deep cleans and blocks odors safely at a microscopic
level for a lasting effect on linen and clothing, as well as the environment.

The PROBAC Biologicals range of household and institutional cleaners is available in concentrates for diluting, and in convenient re-usable trigger packs, which saves you money
and DOESN’T COST THE EARTH.

PROBAC Biologicals LAUNDRY PRE SPOTTER
incorporates:

- A proprietary surfactant package for
lifting dirt and stains

- A novel biological formulation for in situ
biodegradation of soils

- A unique chemistry for binding odor
molecules with unmatched odor control

ORGANIC DIRT → CO 2 & H 2 O

**How does PROBAC Laundry Pre Spotter work?**

1. The surfactants soften and break down hardened dirt
deposits and lift this dirt off the surfaces that are being
cleaned

2. The chemistry for immediate odor control binds odor
molecules at the source so that they do not travel to the
nose

3. The pro-bacteria and the enzymes they produce activate
and ‘biodegrade’ the dirt and odorous compounds safely, in
the process of cleaning and beyond

4. The pro-bacteria are also functional in ‘biodegrading’ the
chemical elements2
