and all bathroom surfaces**

Deep cleans at a microscopic level, ***achieving
sustainable microbial stability for up to three days***
after cleaning

Residual cleaning effect – surfaces stay cleaner
for longer

Biodegrades organic dirt instead of chemical
lifting and shifting

Safe to use and beneficial for Grey Water
and Septic Tank systems

Phosphate and nonylphenol free

ENVIRONMENTAL BEST PRACTICE

>>**CLEANING THE WAY NATURE INTENDED**

A unique, effective biogenic
chemistry for total bathroom
deep cleaning and deodorizing at a microscopic
level.

PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER
is a technologically advanced deep
cleaner and deodorizer formulated for organic
waste common to all bathroom surfaces,
baths, showers, basins and toilets. 

>**PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER combines:**

>>• ***A novel bio-chemical formulation for
immediate odor control***

>>• ***A unique surfactant package for lifting dirt
and stains***

>>• ***The long lasting, microscopic deep cleaning
benefits of pro-bacterial bio-chemistry***

How does PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER work?

The chemistry for immediate odor control and biogenic
(bacterial) components targets odorous compounds for
degradation. 

The specialized pro-bacteria in PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER then biodegrade the organic
compounds that cause odor and staining, breaking
them down to benign and odorless compounds such as
carbon dioxide and water.

>**Organic residues become harmless CO2 & H2O**

The combined effect makes PROBAC BATHROOM CLEANER a highly effective, safe to use and
environmentally preferable odor controller and hard
surface cleaner.
