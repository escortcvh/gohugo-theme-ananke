We provide Port Elizabeth and surrounds with  earth friendly alternatives, for cleaning and maintenence, in both homes and business's and to hopefully, thereby repair in a small way the damage done to our planet by the use of harsh chemicals which ultimately flow into our rivers and the sea's, causing over time, destruction to the environment and wild life living in these environments and, long term,leaving a legacy of nothing for future generations to enjoy.

***SO LETS BE RESPONSIBLE AND GO GREEN!*** 

If you live in Port Elizabeth, or are coming here for the day and are interested in moving over to safer and healthier alternatives to your every day cleaning products, then please have a look at our product range of **"GREEN"** alternatives and give us a call for more information on products that won't cost us the earth.
